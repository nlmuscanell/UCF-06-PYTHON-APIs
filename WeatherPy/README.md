Python API Challenges

## WeatherPy - Analysis Complete

Using Python APIs to analyze the weather conditions for 500+ cities around the world. Cities were randomly selected and picked by their latitude and longitude coordinates. A series of scatter plots show the relationships (if any) between latitude and various weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Finally, linear regression analyses were conducted to statistically test these relationships, but were done for the nothern and southern hemispheres separately.
